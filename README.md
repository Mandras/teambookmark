## What is it ?

TeamBookmark is an addon for Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Opera.

It is used to easily synchronize a bookmark folder with a team.

To share a bookmark folder is very simple, just share a `TeamKey` to the team members; then put it in the options of the extension.

Your team will be able to consult / modify / create new bookmarks.

To retrieve a `TeamKey`, you must register on the website [https://www.teambookmark.org](https://www.teambookmark.org)

**The service is 100% free !**
